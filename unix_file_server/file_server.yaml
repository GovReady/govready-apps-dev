    title: User Settings
    type: longtext
    prompt: |
      Describe the Unix user settings used on {{hostname}} to limit access.

      * Are you using automatic deactivation of accounts after a period of no logins? (What is the expiration period?)

      * Are lockouts used after a certain number of failed logins? (How many failed logins triggers a lockout?)

      * Accounts are required to have long passwords (at least 14 characters). What is the password policy?

  - id: network_segmented
    title: Is the network segmented?
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Is the file server on a segmented network appropriate for the trust level of the information on the file server?

      The network should be segmented based on the sensitivity, label, or classification level of the information stored on the servers. Separated virtual local area networks with firewall filtering should ensure that only authorized individuals are able to communicate with systems necessary to fulfill their specific responsibilities.

      All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted.

      *We'll ask you about your plan of action next.*

  - id: network_segmentation
    title: Network Segmentation Description
    type: longtext
    prompt: Describe the network segment that {{hostname}} is on.

  - id: network_segmentation_poam
    title: Network Segmentation POAM
    type: longtext
    prompt: |
      What is your plan of acton for improving the network segmentation of {{hostname}}?

      The network should be
      
      * segmented based on the sensitivity, label, or classification level of the information stored on the servers
      * using separated virtual local area networks with firewall filtering
      * and all communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted.

      Describe how you will achieve any pending objectives. Include milestones, expected dates of completion, and
      who is responsible for the actions.
    impute:
      - condition: network_segmentation == 'yes'
        value: ~
   
  - id: login_message
    title: Login Message
    type: longtext
    prompt: |
      What warning message is shown to users during the logon process for {{hostname}} alerting them of consequences for unauthorized access?

      The login message is shown during the logon process both in a terminal and as a part of a graphical desktop environment login prompt.

      An appropriate warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers.
      The message banner must be displayed immediately prior to, or as part of, login prompts.”
