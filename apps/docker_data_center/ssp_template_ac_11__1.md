## Authentication and Authorization Service (eNZi)

'Per the requirements of AC-2 (5), Docker Enterprise Edition
can be configured to enforce user session lifetime limits and renewal
thresholds. These options can be found within the Universal Control
Plane Admin Settings under the "Auth" section. Configurable options
include the initial lifetime (in hours) of a user''s session and the
renewal threshold of a session (in hours). Upon the expiration of the
configured session thresholds, a user will be locked out of his/her
session.'
