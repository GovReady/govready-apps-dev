          Don't over think this. Rules of Behavior are just the major Do's and Dont's users and administrators receive and agree to abide by as part of their pre-access training. (The requirement flows from See Section (h) of Appendix III to OMB Circular A-130 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-18, Rev. 1 implemented under FISMA.)

    Rules of Behavior 

    In this module, we'll ask you to describe the responsibilities and expected behavior of users
    and administrators of your organization's information systems and devices.

    {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}
    You said your organization's Rules of Behavior don't exist. We'll draft a version from your answers to these questions.
    {% endif %}
    
    This information will {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}also{% endif %} be used to describe the essense of your rules in your compliance documentation for auditors.
