The requirement for multifactor authentication should not be interpreted as requiring federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC)like solutions. A variety of multifactor solutions (including those with replay resistance) using tokens and biometrics are commercially available. Such solutions may employ hard tokens (e.g., smartcards, key fobs, or dongles) or soft tokens to store user credentials.] for local and network access [Footnote: Local access is any access to a system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.
